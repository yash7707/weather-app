# Weather App

This is a simple Weather App built using React and Vite. The app allows users to get weather information for a specified location.

## **Features**

- **Fetch current weather data** from an API
- **Display weather details** such as temperature, humidity, and conditions
- **Built with modern web technologies** including React and Vite for fast builds and optimized development experience

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### **Assumptions**

- The app is assumed to be fetching data from a public weather API (you may need to add your own API key depending on the weather service being used).
- Users should have **Node.js** and a package manager such as npm installed for development.
  
### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn (npm is bundled with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project zip file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server. The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
